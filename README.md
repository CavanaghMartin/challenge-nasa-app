SC React Test:

Using Create React App or your custom solution (React is a must), build an app that: 
	- Connects to the NASA API (https://api.nasa.gov/)<br/>
	- Obtains photos from the 'Mars Rover' endpoint<br/>
	- Allows the user to see the photos of each rover (Curiosity, Opportunity and	Spirit)<br/>
	- The photos list should be paginated showing a max of 25 photos per page (dynamic loading similar to facebook/instagram will be nice, but not required)<br/>//paginate
	- Allows the user to filter the rover photos by camera<br/>//filter
	- By default it shows the latest photos for current day<br/>query
	- Allows the user to search for photos based on 'Earth Day' date (2020-09-22)<br/>query
	- Allows the user to search for photos based on the 'Sol' date (2890)<br/>//query

	Optional:
	- Let the user store search parameters as favorites or bookmarks that can be recalled in the future (Local storage is accepted, any serverless way of storing data is also accepted)
	- A lot of extra points if you include a few tests.
	- We don't care about the UX design, but a nicely styled app would get extra points :D


- We will check for coding style and consistency mostly, we are interested on seeing how you think and organize a project.
- Please use a linter!


When you finish the test, push it as a public repository in github, gitlab, bitbucket or similar and send us the repository URL.(Editado)
